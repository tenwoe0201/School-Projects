# School-Projects
  Tic tac toe is one of the first projects I did in class. The code is designed to force win in tic tac toe when the system plays against itself.
  
  File I/O : It was my first time using File I/O and I learned how to access contents in file and manipulate them.
  
  Pokemon Go : This code file usually comes with some other folder that contains all the pictures of the pokemons that are available, so the code is written to take in a folder of pictures. The project uses the concept of classes and the graphical user interface of Python to create this game which relies on luck and probability.
  
  Project 4 : The main file of this project, MyMaze.java, uses stacks to create a maze with walls. Then the concept of queues is used to solve the maze. To lower time complexity, LinkedNodes are used to create a "list" of infinite length.
  
  streams.ml: Creating stream modules so that we can generate something to some extent.
  
  search_wolf: using states of the wolf, goat, cabbage, and the person to get them across the river safely following the rules. Multiple answers can be given using               exceptions. 
  
  qu_quiz.ml: adding "qu" to a workd and rescrambling to find a word from the dictionary.

# School-Projects
  Tic tac toe is one of the first projects I did in class. The code is designed to force win in tic tac toe when the system plays against itself.
  
  File I/O : It was my first time using File I/O and I learned how to access contents in file and manipulate them.
  
  Pokemon Go : This code file usually comes with some other folder that contains all the pictures of the pokemons that are available, so the code is written to take in a folder of pictures. The project uses the concept of classes and the graphical user interface of Python to create this game which relies on luck and probability.
